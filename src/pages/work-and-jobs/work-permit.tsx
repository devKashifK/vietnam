        <p>
          Identifying the type of work permit you need is a crucial step in the
          process of working legally in a foreign country, such as Canada. The
          choice of work permit largely depends on the nature and duration of
          your intended employment. Understanding the various categories and
          requirements for work permits is essential to ensure you meet the
          specific criteria and regulations that apply to your situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to research and consult with immigration authorities as
          GTR Worldwide to determine the right work permit for your needs.
          Ensuring that you have the correct work permit is not only a legal
          requirement but also crucial for your overall work experience, your
          rights, and your ability to take advantage of other opportunities,
          such as pathways to permanent residency in Canada

        <p>
          You'll typically need a job offer from a Canadian employer before
          applying for a work permit (LMIA/ JAL process may needed).
        </p>
        <p>
          Foreigners can apply for a work permit in Canada without a job offer
          under specific circumstances. One of the primary pathways to obtaining
          a work permit without a job offer is through Canada's Express Entry
          system and Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs).

            <li>Other supporting documents specific to your application</li>
