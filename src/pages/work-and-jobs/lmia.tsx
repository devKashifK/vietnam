                Assessment is well known to those who seeking Canada immigration
                as a confirm selection. First of all, one must know about LMIA
                and why it is important for any employer!Labour Market Impact
                Assessment as it’s reflected by the name, paperwork needed to be
                done if any Canadian employer wants to hire a foreign national

                According to the Canada law, you can not hire someone from
                outside Canada if there are candidates within Canada. Canada
                always gives priority to them who living in Canada as a citizen
                or with work-permit or holding permanent residence. So as you
                can see it’s quite difficult to get an LMIA and costly as well.
                Any employer must go through a 3-4 advertisement before applying
                for the LMIA.
