                Other than the regular visa application programs, people can
                also apply for a visa or even permanent residence under certain
                sponsorship programs which allow eligible individuals to sponsor
                their close family members for permanent residency in Canada.

                Types of Family Sponsorship in Canada:
                <ul className="pl-6 list-disc">
                  <li> Sponsoring a spouse or partner</li>

              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                The processing time may vary depending on the type of
                sponsorship.

              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                You must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident and meet
                specific financial requirements to ensure your ability to
                support the sponsored family members.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                Sponsors commit to providing financial support to the sponsored
                family members for a specific period.

              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                Sponsored family members must also meet specific eligibility
                criteria depending on the program. For example, in the case of
                sponsoring a spouse, the marriage or common-law partnership must
                be genuine, and for sponsoring parents and grandparents, they
                must pass a medical examination.

              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                If you don't meet the eligibility criteria for family
                sponsorship programs (e.g., due to age, marital status, or
                indirect family relationships), you may consider applying
                through provincial nominee programs (PNPs)
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                You may receive additional points if you have family members who
                are Canadian citizens or permanent residents. This can increase
                your chances of receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA) from the
                province or the Canadian government.
