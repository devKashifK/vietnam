          British Columbia welcomes entrepreneurs from around the world to
          discover the many business opportunities across all regions of the
          province. Entrepreneurs can open a business in one of B.C.’s smaller
          communities and experience first-hand why many choose to live outside
          of a large urban center for their families.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the Entrepreneur Immigration (EI) Regional Pilot, the Province
          offers an immigration pathway for enterprising individuals who are
          looking to start a new business in a small community and make B.C.
          their new home.

          want to settle in one that is not participating in the EI Regional
          Pilot, or purchase an existing business, you are not eligible for this
