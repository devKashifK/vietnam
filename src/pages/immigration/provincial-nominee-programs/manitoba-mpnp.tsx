                The Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) is an immigration
                initiative that enables Manitoba to nominate individuals for
                permanent residency in Canada. Designed to address economic and
                labor market needs, the program attracts skilled workers,
                businesspeople, and families to contribute to Manitoba's growth.

              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                The program includes streams like Skilled Worker Overseas,
                Skilled Worker in Manitoba, Business Investor, and International
                Education, each tailored to specific qualifications and skills
                required in the province. Successful candidates receive an
                invitation to apply for permanent residence, contributing to
                Manitoba's economic and demographic goals.
