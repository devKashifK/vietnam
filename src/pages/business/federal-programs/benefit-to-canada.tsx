            C10 is a job-specific work permit. This indicates that individuals
            who receive this permit can work exclusively for the specified
            employer. To obtain the C10 work permit, applicants must secure a
            job offer from a Canadian employer. Alternatively, foreign
            professionals may qualify for this work permit if they are
            entrepreneurs or meet the IRCC criteria for self-employed
            individuals (in fields of culture, arts, and athletics).

            This provision is typically used for temporary situations rather
            than permanent immigration. Foreign professionals can use the C10
            work permit to come to Canada and gain valuable work experience.
            They can then use this experience to apply for permanent residence
            through Express Entryâ€™s Canadian Experience Class program
