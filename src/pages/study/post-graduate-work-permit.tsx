                Canada offers a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) program to
                international students who have completed a program of study at
                a designated learning institution in Canad
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                The PGWP allows you to work in Canada after completing your
                studies. You can work for any employer in Canada, and you are
                not restricted to a specific job or location.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                Work experience gained through the PGWP increases your
                opportunities when you apply for permanent residency in Canada
                through the Canadian Experience Class or other immigration
                pathways.

              <Title subtitle="Eligibility:" />
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                To be eligible for a PGWP, you must have completed a program of
                study at a designated learning institution in Canada. The
                program must be at least 8 months in duration. The length of the
                work permit issued will depend on the length of your program.
              </p>
              <Title subtitle="PGWP validity: " />
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                The validity of the PGWP will depend on the length of your
                program. If your program was 8 months or more but less than 2
                years, the PGWP will be valid for a period equal to the length
                of your program. If your program was 2 years or more, the PGWP
                may be issued for 3 years.

              <Title subtitle="Application Process:" />
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                You must apply for the PGWP within 180 days (approximately 6
                months) of receiving written confirmation of completing your
                program and being awarded your degree, diploma, or certificate
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                You apply for the PGWP online. Ensure that you have all the
                required documents, such as proof of completion of your program
                and other necessary documentation.

                You need to know if you are eligible to work after you graduate.
                Not all designated learning institutions and not all programs of
                study make you eligible for the Post-Graduation Work Permit
                Program. If you plan to attend a post-secondary school, make
                sure it is on this list.
