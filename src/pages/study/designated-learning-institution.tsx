                To apply for a study permit, you need an acceptance letter from
                a designated learning institution. A designated learning
                institution is a school approved by a provincial or territorial
                government to host international students.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                All primary and secondary schools in Canada are designated
                learning institutions.
              </p>
              <Title subtitle="Why do I need DLI Number?" />
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                Applicants must provide the Designated Learning Institution
                number (DLI #) for their school of choice. The DLI number is the
                number that begins with the letter “O” on the study permit
                application form.
              </p>

              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                In certain cases, students may be exempt from providing a letter
                from a DLI, or from providing a DLI number in their application.
                These cases may include, but are not limited to:
                <ul className="pl-6 list-disc">
                  <li>
                    Students at a primary or secondary institution. These
                    schools are all automatically designated, and no DLI number
                    is provided
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A family member of a foreign national whose application for
                    a work permit or a study permit is approved in writing
                    before the foreign national enters Canada. In this case, the
                    family member may obtain an open study permit.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Some institutions in Quebec are designated by the provincial
                    government, but do not have a unique DLI number.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-black/60 text-left">
                Sometimes, institutions may lose their designated status.
                Depending on when the status is lost, the international student
                may be affected.
