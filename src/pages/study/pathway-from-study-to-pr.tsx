            The competition in Canada’s Express Entry system is currently very
            high, and the required scores for receiving an Invitation to Apply
            (ITA) for permanent residency through the Canadian Experience Class
            (CEC) or Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) programs are quite
            competitive. Therefore, if you plan to study abroad and wish to
            stay, work, and obtain permanent residency in Canada, you should
            consider your choice of school, study programs, and provincial
            immigration policies.

            Some provinces and territories in Canada offer Post-Graduation
            Immigration Programs specifically for international students. These
            programs typically require that international students have
            completed a study program in the respective province or territory
            and meet specific requirements. If you’re interested, consider
